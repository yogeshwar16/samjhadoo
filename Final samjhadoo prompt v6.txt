- Open source APIs/services (WebRTC, Firebase Auth/FCM, Stripe/Razorpay, OAuth2, OpenAI-compatible APIs)

---

## Platform responsibilities with detailed requirements

### üì± Android app (Java + Material Design 3)
- **Landing & Onboarding:**
  - Provide a splash screen, followed by 2‚Äì3 intro pages that clearly explain core features: live video/audio mentorship, instant mentor advice, friendly talk for loneliness/anxiety (no clinical medical claims), and safety.
  - Show intent prompt: ‚ÄúWhat brings you here today?‚Äù with options: Learn Something | Share Expertise | Friendly Talk.
  - Implement login via Google, LinkedIn, Facebook (OAuth). If social login not available or user declines, fallback to mobile OTP via Firebase. Ensure failure-safe UX and clear error messages.
  - Profile completion must collect: Name, Age, Gender, Auto-detected Location (with user permission; allow manual override), Language(s), Interests (multi-select), Short-term Goals, Long-term Goals. Persist all fields in backend profile API.
  - If admin enables verification, trigger selfie capture and ID upload flow; perform AI-assisted match (backend result required before enabling monetized features). Show user privacy notice and consent explicitly.

- **Mentee features:**
  - Dashboard must show personalized mentor suggestions based on skills, interests, goals, urgency, rating, availability, and price. Include quick filters and a search bar with filters: skill, price/free, rating, urgency.
  - Session type selector: Skill Help or Friendly Talk; store selection to tailor matching and UI.
  - Booking flow for 15/30/60-min slots: check mentor availability, show timezone-aware slots, confirm booking, and provide calendar add. Handle cancellations/rescheduling per backend policy.
  - Live sessions: WebRTC video/audio, optional screen share, real-time notes (saved to backend), replay if both parties consent. Handle network changes gracefully; show reconnect UI.
  - Urgency tagging (Casual | Soon | ASAP) must influence match priority and sorting.
  - AI assistance: 
    - Master AI (freemium) can answer FAQs, propose mentors, offer nudges, and do basic emotional check-ins.
    - Agentic AI (premium) performs advanced matching, session prep (agenda, links), and post-session insights (action items).
  - AI-powered discovery: surface trending topics and suggested queries (e.g., ‚ÄúDSA prep for interviews,‚Äù ‚Äúresume review,‚Äù ‚Äúmock interview‚Äù) aligned with mentee interests/skill gaps. 
  - Notifications: Firebase FCM for session reminders, booking updates, follow-ups, and personalized nudges.
  - Payments: support freemium, pay-per-session, festival discounts, and tier/city-based pricing via Stripe/Razorpay SDK. Display GST/fees clearly before payment.

- **Mentor features:**
  - Onboarding collects skills (tagged taxonomy), hourly rate (min/max constraints), bio, availability windows, and Motivator opt-in (friendly talk support).
  - Dashboard displays revenue, calendar with availability management, session history with filters, reviews with moderation status, and a ‚Äútrending mentee queries‚Äù widget relevant to mentor‚Äôs skills.
  - Session tools include session timer, screen share, collaborative notes, and replay toggle (consent required). 
  - AI Mentor Assistant proposes session talking points and prep material (links, checklists) before each session.
  - Rewards & gamification: badges and tier progression (e.g., ‚ÄúStartup Whisperer‚Äù) triggered by milestones (sessions completed, rating thresholds).
  - Notifications for bookings, new reviews, payouts processed, and new offer plans to earn.

- **Friendly Talk module:**
  - Mood onboarding asks current emotional state (Lonely, Curious, Anxious, Excited, Just browsing) and preferences (gender, age range, language, cultural affinity).
  - Dashboard tabs: Talk Now, Find a Friend, My Circle, Mood Themes, Confession Corner.
  - Matching logic uses mood + interests + availability; if no match, place request in a queue and notify when a mentor/motivator becomes available.
  - Chat interface supports text/audio/video, an anonymous toggle (hide real name), and report/block features. Provide clear safety UI and escalation path.
  - Drop-in audio rooms for casual motivation (moderated). Provide room topic, participant count, moderation tools (mute/kick/report).
  - AI moderation pre-screens for harmful content; do emotional check-ins during long chats.

- **Ads:**
  - Integrate AdMob SDK for banner ads (non-intrusive at dashboard bottom), interstitial ads (post-booking confirmation only), and rewarded ads (unlock extra friendly talk minutes or limited premium trial).
  - Implement frequency control and consent gating: show ads only if user consented; premium plan removes ads entirely.

- **Privacy:**
  - First-launch consent screen covering data collection, cookies, analytics, ads, and AI assistance. Log consent status and timestamp with userId.
  - Settings must include: opt-out of ads personalization, request data download, request account deletion, notification frequency controls, language/theme selection.
  - Show link to Privacy Policy page and localized notice. No personalized ads without explicit consent.

- **Limited admin on mobile (ops subset):**
  - Approve/reject mentors (view documents and basic profile), with comments.
  - View flagged users/content; apply quick actions (warn, temporary suspend, escalate).
  - Quick dispute resolution (approve refund, escalate to web admin).
  - Push urgent announcements to specific segments (region, role, language).

---

### üçè iOS app (Swift + SwiftUI + Combine)
- **Parity with Android feature set** using SwiftUI:
  - Onboarding: multi-page intro, intent prompt, Sign in with Apple plus Google/LinkedIn/Facebook; OTP fallback via Firebase; profile completion; optional selfie-ID verification when enabled.
  - Mentee features: dashboard, filters + search, AI matching, booking (15/30/60), live sessions via WebRTC (integrate CallKit for native calling UX), urgency tagging, AI nudges, APNs notifications via Firebase, payments via Stripe/Razorpay SDKs with Apple HIG-compliant flows.
  - Mentor features: onboarding, calendar & availability, revenue, reviews, session tools, AI mentor assistant, badges/tiers, notifications.
  - Friendly Talk: mood onboarding, preferences, tabs and chat (text/audio/video with AVFoundation), drop-in audio rooms with moderation, AI safety checks.
  - Ads: AdMob iOS banners/interstitial/rewarded with consent and frequency control; premium removes ads.
  - Privacy: first-launch consent, settings for opt-out/data rights, privacy policy link.
  - Mobile admin subset: same limited ops as Android. 
  - UX: Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines; keep design language consistent with Material 3 where possible (spacing, clarity, accessibility).

---

## AI integration layer ‚Äî behavior and safeguards

- **Master AI (freemium):**
  - Provides FAQs, mentor suggestions, lightweight nudges, emotional check-ins. Limited depth and rate-limited; never makes final decisions without user confirmation.
- **Agentic AI (premium):**
  - Advanced matching: weighs urgency, skill fit, availability, rating, price, and user goals.
  - Session prep: agenda and resource suggestions tailored to user‚Äôs query and mentor‚Äôs background.
  - Post-session insights: concise summary, action items, recommended next steps (e.g., ‚ÄúPractice DSA 3x/week; schedule mock interview Thursday‚Äù).
- **AI matching & discovery:**
  - Surfaces trending skills/topics and suggested queries regionally and globally. Must be explainable (show why a mentor was suggested).
- **AI mentor assistant:**
  - Offers structured talking points and resources before sessions; keeps a neutral, non-clinical tone.
- **AI moderation:**
  - Pre-screens friendly talk and reviews; flags potential harm; routes to moderator if needed. Never provides medical or legal advice.
- **Localization & dynamic theming:**
  - Smart language detection (telecom/IP/GPS with user permission), user-select language override, minimal dropdown with global toggle. Full UI translation for supported languages. Dynamic taglines and themes around festivals/events (colors, banners, micro-animations) with safe defaults.
- **Integration rules:**
  - Use AI Gateway service; log all interactions; enforce premium access for Agentic AI; fallback to Master AI on errors; admin monitoring for usage, failure rates, and cost controls.

---

## Notifications ‚Äî design and controls

- **Context-aware notifications:**
  - Tailor content by user background, budget, location, interests, and session history.
- **UX behavior:**
  - Low animations/flash; avoid spammy patterns. Provide frequency controls in settings.
- **Performance analytics:**
  - Track open rates, CTR, and conversions. Example targets: ‚Äúinterview tips‚Äù notifications achieve ~45% engagement; ‚Äúbusiness ideas‚Äù ~62% (use as sample test goals, not hard-coded).
- **Compliance:**
  - Respect consent settings; provide opt-out. Localize content and time windows.

---

## Ads ‚Äî smart & non-intrusive

- **Principles:**
  - Contextual ads; blend into feed/session suggestions; no popups; frequency capped (admin-configurable, e.g., max 2 per session flow).
  - Ads must feel like recommendations, not interruptions; never gate essential features behind ads.
- **Android/iOS:**
  - AdMob SDK banners (dashboard), interstitials (post-booking), rewarded (extra minutes). Consent required; premium plan removes ads.
- **Web:**
  - AdSense or Prebid.js banners/native ads in sidebar, Knowledge Hub, community feed. Respect consent and premium plan.
- **Admin controls:**
  - Campaign management, targeting rules, frequency caps, analytics (CTR, revenue, eCPM). Store ad performance logs for dashboards.

---

## Privacy & compliance ‚Äî mandatory behaviors

- **Transparency:**
  - Show clear disclosures of data collected and purpose across onboarding and settings.
- **User rights:**
  - Provide UI to download data and request deletion. Confirm before irreversible actions.
- **Security:**
  - End-to-end encryption for chats/calls where feasible; transport encryption (TLS) mandatory; secure payment handling; redact sensitive PII in logs.
- **Compliance:**
  - GDPR, HIPAA, DPDP-ready. No personalized ads without explicit consent. Localize privacy notices. Store consent status (userId, consentStatus, timestamp, channel).
- **Privacy policy page:**
  - Must be accessible from onboarding, footer (web), and settings (mobile). Include ad disclosures and AI assistance disclosures.

## üìù GitHub Copilot Prompt ‚Äì Pricing Engine for Samjhadoo.com

```markdown
# GitHub Copilot Prompt: Pricing Engine for Samjhadoo.com

We are building **Samjhadoo.com**, a mentorship + friendly talk platform.  
We need a **Pricing Engine** that is deterministic, auditable, and fully controlled by Admin. Copilot must generate backend code (Spring Boot Java), DB schema, APIs, services, DTOs, test stubs, and Admin UI components (React.js) to manage pricing.  

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Calculate session prices based on tiers, mentor rates, regional multipliers, surge rules, promos, commission, taxes, and credits.
- Provide **calc endpoint** for preview and **confirm endpoint** for booking with immutable snapshot.
- Allow Admin to manage all pricing rules (tiers, overrides, multipliers, promos, commission).
- Store audit logs for every pricing change and booking confirmation.
- Ensure compliance with GDPR/DPDP: no hidden charges, transparent breakdown.

---

## üìä Pricing Model
1. **Base Tiers**: Bronze, Silver, Gold with hourly rates (e.g., 300/600/1200 INR).
2. **Slot Pricing**: price = hourly_rate * slot_minutes / 60.
3. **Mentor Overrides**: mentors can set rates within admin-defined min/max; admin can override directly.
4. **Regional Multipliers**: adjust price by city/region (e.g., Metro 1.2x, Tier-2 1.0x).
5. **Surge Pricing**: apply multiplier when demand > supply for skill/region; capped by admin.
6. **Promos/Discounts**: percentage or fixed, scheduled by admin (e.g., Diwali 10% off).
7. **Agentic AI Add-on**: premium users can add AI fee (fixed or %).
8. **Commission & Taxes**: platform commission deducted; GST/tax added as line item.
9. **Credits/Rewards**: rewarded ads or gamification credits can reduce price.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Models (PostgreSQL + JPA Entities)
- **PricingTier**: id, name, hourly_rate, min_rate, max_rate, active.
- **MentorPricing**: mentor_id, base_rate, enforced_by_admin, effective_from/to.
- **RegionalMultiplier**: region_code, multiplier, effective_from/to.
- **SurgeRule**: skill_id, region_code, demand_threshold, multiplier, cap_multiplier.
- **PromoRule**: id, name, type (PERCENTAGE|FIXED), value, regions[], start_dt, end_dt.
- **CommissionPolicy**: id, percent, tiers[], start_dt, end_dt.
- **SessionPriceBreakdown**: session_id, mentor_rate, slot_minutes, multipliers, promo_applied, commission, tax, ai_fee, credits, final_price.
- **PricingAuditLog**: actor, action, entity, before, after, reason, timestamp.

---

## üîå Backend APIs (Spring Boot)
### Public
- **POST /api/pricing/calc**  
  Input: { mentorId, slotMinutes, region, skillId, userPlan, date, useAgenticAI, credits }  
  Output: SessionPriceBreakdown JSON with explain[] lines.  
- **POST /api/pricing/confirm**  
  Input: { breakdownToken, userId, bookingDetails }  
  Output: BookingId + immutable price snapshot.

### Admin
- **/api/admin/pricing/tiers** (CRUD)  
- **/api/admin/pricing/mentor/{id}** (override rates)  
- **/api/admin/pricing/regional-multiplier** (CRUD)  
- **/api/admin/pricing/surge** (CRUD)  
- **/api/admin/pricing/promo** (CRUD)  
- **/api/admin/pricing/commission** (CRUD)  
- **/api/admin/pricing/audit** (list logs)  
- **/api/admin/pricing/simulate** (what-if preview)

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Admin UI (React.js + Material UI)
- **Pricing Dashboard**: list tiers, edit rates, toggle active.
- **Mentor Override Screen**: search mentor, set enforced rate, show history.
- **Regional Multiplier Editor**: set multipliers per city/region.
- **Surge Rules Manager**: define thresholds, multipliers, caps.
- **Promo Calendar**: create promos, schedule start/end, preview effect.
- **Commission & Tax Screen**: set commission %, tax rules.
- **What-If Simulator**: input mentor/slot/region ‚Üí preview breakdown.
- **Audit Log Viewer**: show before/after diffs, reasons, timestamps.

---

## üì± Frontend Behavior (Android/iOS/Web)
- Always call `/api/pricing/calc` before booking; show full breakdown (mentor rate, multipliers, promos, commission, tax, AI fee, credits).
- Confirm booking only after `/api/pricing/confirm` returns immutable snapshot.
- Mentor dashboards show expected earnings after commission.
- Premium users see Agentic AI add-on option with price.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safeguards
- Immutable booking snapshots; no retroactive changes.
- Surge multipliers capped; overrides logged with reason.
- Promos cannot stack unless admin enables stacking.
- All admin changes require `reason` and are logged.
- Rounding rules consistent (nearest rupee/cent).

---

## üìà Monitoring & Alerts
- Metrics: avg_session_price, calc_error_rate, surge_trigger_rate, promo_use_rate, agentic_ai_attach_rate.
- Alerts: >20% spike in avg price, surge > cap, calc errors >1%.

---

## ‚úÖ Copilot Tasks
- Generate Spring Boot entities, repositories, services, controllers, DTOs, Swagger docs.
- Generate Flyway migrations for pricing tables.
- Generate React Admin UI components for pricing management.
- Generate unit tests for pricing logic (tiers, promos, surge, overrides).
- Generate integration tests for booking flow (calc ‚Üí confirm).
- Generate monitoring hooks (Prometheus metrics).
- Generate audit log persistence and viewer.

---

## üîí Non-Functional Requirements
- Use BigDecimal for currency math (no floats).  
- All APIs idempotent and deterministic.  
- Internationalization: currency/locale formatting.  
- Performance: /api/pricing/calc <200ms under load.  
- Compliance: GDPR/DPDP ‚Äî transparent breakdown, consent for promos/ads.  
```
