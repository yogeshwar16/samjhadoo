## üöÄ Recommended Next Action

**START FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT NOW** using the current backend APIs.

Build a simple, clean web application with:
1. User registration/login
2. Profile creation
3. Browse mentors

1. **Do you want to launch an MVP quickly?** ‚Üí Start frontend now
2. **Do you want all advanced features first?** ‚Üí Continue backend development (4-6 months)
3. **Do you have a team for parallel development?** ‚Üí Split work across multiple developers

The current backend is ready for frontend integration. The choice is yours!
